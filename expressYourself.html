                    Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled.
                    Talking about your feelings isn’t a sign of weakness. 
                    It’s part of taking charge of your wellbeing and doing what you can to stay healthy.
                    Talking can be a way to cope with a problem you’ve been carrying around in your head for a while. 
                    Just being listened to can help you feel supported and less alone. 
                    And it works both ways. If you open up, it might encourage others to do the same.

                    Start With A Text If A Face-To-Face Talk Is Too Intimidating.<br>
                    It could be a plain old text message with a note that says, 
                    “I have some important things on my mind and need to make time to talk to you about them.”
