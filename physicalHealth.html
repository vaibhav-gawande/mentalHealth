                <h2>Have A Sound Sleep</h2>    
                <p>It’s no secret that sleep plays an important role in good physical and mental health. 
                    Sleep deprivation can leave you feeling irritable and exhausted in the short-term, but it can also have serious long-term health consequences as well. 
                    Lack of sleep is linked to a number of unfavorable health consequences including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.
                    Sound sleep is important for the proper functioning of the body.
                    It helps our body to get rid of excess waste and makes us feel freshened.
                    We should get 7-10 hours of sound sleep to feel relaxed and fresh.
