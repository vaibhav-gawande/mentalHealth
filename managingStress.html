                <p>
                    Taking the time to relax every day helps to manage stress and to protect the body from the effects of stress. 
                    You can choose from a variety of techniques, such as deep breathing, imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation. 
                    There are many online and smart phone apps that provide guidance on these techniques; although some entail purchase costs, many are available free of charge.

                    If you are like most people, your life may be filled with too many demands and too little time. 
                    For the most part, these demands are ones we have chosen. 
                    You can free up time by practicing time-management skills like asking for help when itâ€™s appropriate, setting priorities, pacing yourself, and reserving time to take care of yourself.

                <h2>Stop using tobacco and nicotine products</h2>    
                <p>
                    People who use nicotine often refer to it as a stress reliever. 
                    However, nicotine actually places more stress on the body by increasing physical arousal and reducing blood flow and breathing.

                <p>
                    Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. 
                    During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. 
                    This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.
